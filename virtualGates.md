# Virtual Gate Research

To angle the line of interest (LOI), uncomment line 98 of capacitylimit.py.
A future optimization could be to add a flag to toggle between the different types of lines of interest implementations.

## Implemented Virtual Gates

1. Straight line
2. Angled line
3. Multiple lines
4. 2D vs 3D - TODO?

### Straight Line Results

### Angled Line Results

### Multiple Line Results


### 2D vs 3D Line Results
I will check out Go solutions before returning back here for exploration.


#### Other Insights

##### Line Distance apart
I randomly chose XX pixels apart for my LOIs.
